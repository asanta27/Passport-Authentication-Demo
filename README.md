# Passport-Authentication-Demo

The objective of this project was to secure a secret page using Passport (http://www.passportjs.org/).

The secret page can only be accessed when a user is logged in.

The application features four options a user can choose:

- Sign Up
- Login
- Logout
- View Secret page (only available when logged in)

User data is stored in MongoDB.
